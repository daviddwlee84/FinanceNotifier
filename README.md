# Finance Notifier

Periodically send webhook with stock or other finance feed summary.

This can do what Chart-Img can do, and it's free.

## Getting Started

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install

python app.py
# or
flask run
```

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

## Todo

- [X] Able to host TradingView widget
- [X] Able to take screenshot
- [X] Discord webhook
- [X] Able to pass HTTP GET parameter to create chart
- [X] Periodically trigger
- [X] Docker
- [ ] ~~Load config into `periodic/server.py`'s docker~~
- [ ] Try add indicators, strategies, studies on the TradingView Advanced Chart
- [ ] What if "click" the save image button on the TradingView Advanced Chart?

## Trouble Shooting

### pyppeteer (deprecated)

```txt
OSError: [WinError 14001] The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect. Please see the application event log or use the command-line sxstrace.exe tool for more detail
```

- [Crash on running the example screenshot script from the documentation in VSCode Windows 10 · Issue #248 · pyppeteer/pyppeteer](https://github.com/pyppeteer/pyppeteer/issues/248)
  - If anyone is having this issue; what fixed it for me was to uninstall the python version downloaded from the windows store and install python directly from their webpage. After doing so, I was able to launch Chromium using Pyppeteer.
- [Can't run pyppeteer in local, or on web-based machine such as Replit · Issue #425 · pyppeteer/pyppeteer](https://github.com/pyppeteer/pyppeteer/issues/425)
  - longer updated. Check README.md for more info. You can use Playright instead.

### Scheduler API 404

Seems if host is 0.0.0.0 will have some issue

Just because I am running an old one...
